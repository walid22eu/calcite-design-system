If you'd like to perform some actions prior to closing (ie. warning users they will lose their changes) you can pass a function to the `beforeClose` property. This method will be called prior to close and should return a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise):

```js
function beforeClose() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    // do something async
    resolve(); // this will trigger the close animation
  });
}

const sheet = document.getElementById("my-sheet");
sheet.beforeClose = beforeClose;
```
