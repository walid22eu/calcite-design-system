To open a modal, add the `open` prop. Once the opening animation is complete, the `calciteModalOpen` event will be fired.

To close the modal, simply remove the attribute. This will run your before close method (if provided, see below) and fire the `calciteModalClose` event after the animation and teardown is complete.

```html
<calcite-modal open></calcite-modal>
```
